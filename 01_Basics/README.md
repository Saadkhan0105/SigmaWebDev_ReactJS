## Why React?
- We can use **states**, which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page.
- We can split our app into **multiple components** and reuse those components.
- React uses a **virtual DOM** to efficiently update the UI, which is better than updating content using direct DOM Manipulation.
- **Debugging and maintenance** are easy.

## Features
- Component-based architecture
- State management with React hooks
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- API integration using Axios
- Routing with React Router
